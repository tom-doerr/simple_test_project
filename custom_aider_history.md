#### Improve code quality and fix any issues found in tests or linting. TDD! Add tests for task first before making changes.Task: create a textualize demo interface and document it in the readme  

Okay, I will start by identifying the files that are most likely to need changes based on your request to improve code quality, fix test issues, and create a Textualize demo interface with documentation.

Based on the information you've provided, the following files are likely candidates for modification:

1.  `show_time.py`: This file contains the core logic for the Textual application, including fetching crypto prices and displaying them. It will likely need changes to improve the UI, add new features, or fix bugs.
2.  `tests/test_show_time.py`: This file contains the tests for `show_time.py`. It will need changes to add new tests for the new features, fix existing test failures, and improve test coverage.
3.  `README.md`: This file should be updated to document the Textualize demo interface, including instructions on how to run it and what features it provides.

Do you want me to proceed with generating the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for these files?

Okay, I will start by addressing the failing test `test_show_time_no_textual`. This test fails because the `show_time.py` script exits with code 1 when Textual is not installed, and the test asserts that it should exit with code 0.

To fix this, I will modify the test to expect the correct exit code and check for the expected error message.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

tests/test_show_time.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def test_show_time_no_textual():
    """Test that show_time.py runs without errors when textual is not installed."""
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["python", "show_time.py"], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True
    )
    assert result.returncode == 1
    assert "Textual is not installed" in result.stdout
=======
def test_show_time_no_textual():
    """Test that show_time.py runs without errors when textual is not installed."""
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["python", "show_time.py"], capture_output=True, text=True, check=False
    )
    assert result.returncode == 1
    assert "Textual is not installed" in result.stdout
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

After applying this change, I suggest running the tests to confirm that the test now passes.

```bash
python3.11 -m pytest tests/test_show_time.py
```
