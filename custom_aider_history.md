Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to train a logistic regression model on MNIST using TDD, so first I need to figure out what files are involved. They mentioned adding tests before making changes, so the main files to modify would be the test files and the actual implementation file.

Looking at the existing files, the user provided tests in test_show_time.py, but we need a new test file for the MNIST model. The logical place would be tests/test_mnist.py. Also, the implementation will likely go into a file like mnist_classifier.py or something similar. Since those files aren't in the chat yet, I need to ask the user to add them.

Wait, the user hasn't added any files related to the MNIST task yet. So the first step is to create new test files and the model file. The user's instructions say to use TDD, so I should start by writing tests that define the expected behavior of the logistic regression model.

In the test file, I'll need to test loading the dataset, training the model, and checking accuracy. For the implementation, the model should load MNIST data, preprocess it by scaling, train a logistic regression classifier, and evaluate accuracy. 

I should also consider dependencies. The user might need scikit-learn, matplotlib, and numpy if they're not already installed. So suggesting pip install commands for those would be helpful.

But since the user hasn't added the necessary files to the chat yet, I can't propose SEARCH/REPLACE blocks. Instead, I should list the files that need to be created or modified: tests/test_mnist.py and mnist_classifier.py. Once the user adds those, I can then provide the specific code changes using the required format.

Additionally, the user mentioned linting issues. If there are existing files with issues, but they aren't in the chat, I can't address them yet. So focusing on the new task and ensuring the new code follows best practices and is well-tested is the way to go.

In summary, the key files are the new test file and the model implementation file. The user needs to add these to the chat so I can proceed with the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the actual code.

I'll help create a test-driven solution for training a logistic regression model on MNIST. First, let's identify which files we need to modify/create:

1. We'll need to create a new test file for MNIST model training
2. Create a new implementation file for the MNIST classifier
3. Possibly update requirements/dependencies

First let me ask you to add these files to the chat:
- `tests/test_mnist.py` (new test file)
- `mnist_classifier.py` (new implementation file)

Would you like me to proceed with creating these files? Please confirm which files you'd like me to create/modify.

For reference, when creating the solution we'll need to:
1. Add tests that verify MNIST loading, model training, and accuracy
2. Implement the actual logistic regression with proper preprocessing
3. Ensure code quality with type hints, docstrings, and error handling
4. Add necessary dependencies (scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc)

Would you like me to proceed with creating the test and implementation files?
